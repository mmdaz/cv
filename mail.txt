Dear Professor David Paul ROSSITER,

Hello.

I am writing this letter regarding to the Summer Internship program at HKUST.

I am bachelor science student at AmirKabir University of Technology (Iran) ; studying Computer Engineering.
I have Ranked top 0.3% in the country university entrance exam in more than 137000 participants. (2017).

I am interested in Machine Learning & Model thinking and also Software engineering which is a tool for me to develop models in real world.
And also I am reading some books such as Clean code, Hands-On Machine Learning with
Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, etc.

Pursuing my interests, I have passed a graduate course related to programming and mathematics last semester, and I have taken Applied Linear Algebra, Engineering Statistics and Theory of Machines and Languages (Graduate courses) for my current semester, I am also taking some online courses on Coursera website like Python Programming.

It will be a great experience for me, which I will appreciate for my career, to work with you and your group.
I am sure attending in this Internship program at HKUST will give me more exposure to the various interests of mine in both academic and cultural area.

I have enclosed my resume for your perusal.
